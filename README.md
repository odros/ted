# Exploring EU tenders with Python

This repository contains the work we developed as a final project for our Data Structures and Algorithms course, part of our Master of Data Science for Public Policy program at Hertie. In it we explore TED (Tenders Electronic Daily), the online version of the 'Supplement to the Official Journal' of the EU, dedicated to European public procurement. It publishes 746 thousand procurement award notices a year, including 235 thousand calls for tenders which are worth approximately â‚¬545 billion.

# Components

The repo includes a [`scripts`](/scripts) folder, which contains all the scripts we created for the project. The root directory contains [a Python notebook](https://github.com/m-schildt/TED/blob/main/TED.ipynb) which may be accesed directly within Google's Colaboratory by clicking on the <a href="#"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BeunuU9.png" height=15></a> icon. In it you will find a walk-through of the functionality achieved by our code and an exploratory analysis of the kind of insights that are possible with it.
